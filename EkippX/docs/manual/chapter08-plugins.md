# Chapter 8 - Plugin System

Plugins extend EkippX by registering directives, functions, expanders, and capabilities through a host-owned API.

## Purpose

- Chapter 8 - Plugin System treats `purpose` as part of the public documentation contract.
- Prefer deterministic expansion, explicit options, and reproducible diagnostics over implicit host state.
- Keep examples small enough to compare with a golden output file during smoke testing.
- Record ownership: the caller owns input strings, the context owns registered symbols, and plugins own their private state.
- Preserve source names and line numbers whenever an operation can fail.
- Avoid hidden filesystem access unless the include or plugin policy explicitly permits it.
- Use the same invocation syntax in manuals, tests, examples, and CLI help text.

## Operational Model

- Record ownership: the caller owns input strings, the context owns registered symbols, and plugins own their private state.
- Preserve source names and line numbers whenever an operation can fail.
- Avoid hidden filesystem access unless the include or plugin policy explicitly permits it.
- Use the same invocation syntax in manuals, tests, examples, and CLI help text.

## Minimal Smoke Pattern

```text
@define(NAME, EkippX)
@emitln(&upper(NAME))
```

- Expected output contains `EKIPPX` followed by the configured newline mode.
